## Install Vim:
```Bash
sudo apt install vim
```
```Bash
sudo apt-get install vim
```

## Set Vim as the default text editor:
**Note:** typing vi acts as a symbolic link in debian and will open vim if it is installed. This means that to open a file with vim you can simply type 
```Bash
vi file_name
```
instead of
```Bash
vim file_name
```
For this guide vim will be typed out completely to not cause confusion
